## 📝 What You're Testing

This is the **Ink Inventory Management System**. You can:
- ✅ View all ink items
- ✅ Add new items and change their currency (₪/$/€)
- ✅ See the dashboard with inventory stats
- ✅ Test if currency changes are visible to other users

**Test the currency fix:** Add or edit an item → change its currency → log in with the other account → verify you see the correct currency!
